Main note:
A Flash Card App for the French language, A french word will show up on screen and you have 4 seconds to remember what it means in English, If you guessed it correctly your score goes up and it'll be removed from the words list and added to another file named "words_to_learn.csv".


Technical notes:
The Flash Card App uses the "words_to_learn.csv" file after the inital use of the main words file.
If you wish to add more words or change the words in the main words file, change the "WORDS_FILE" variable to the path of the file you want to use, make sure it's a .csv file with 2 columns only, one named "French" and the other named "English"
