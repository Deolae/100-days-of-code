This app allows the user to store all their passwords locally in a txt file, while also offering a "Generate password" button for a secure random password.

The user starts by entering the website name, then the email used, then they can enter their own password,
or use the "Generate password" button to quickly get a secure password.

The password data is then stored in a file named "password_data.txt" in the same folder.
