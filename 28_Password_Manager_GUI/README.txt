This app allows the user to store all their passwords locally in a .JSON file, with the ability to search for a website name to get the email and password associated with it, while also offering a "Generate password" button for a secure random password, this tool is handy for those who have too many passwords to manage.

The user starts by entering the website name, then the email used, then they can enter their own password,
or use the "Generate password" button to quickly get a secure password.

The password data is then stored in a file named "password_data.json" in the same folder.
