This file contains 2 seperate projects:
1- The Kanye quotes app which will give a random quote from Kanye West on button click.
2- The ISS Overhead app which will send you an email if it's night time and the ISS (International Space Station) is currently above you in the sky.
(You'd have to change the longtitude and latitude in the code to your long and lat, as well as changing the email and password to your credentials)
